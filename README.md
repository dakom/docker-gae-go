# Docker Container for the Google App Engine Go SDK

The release of macOS Sierra broke the version of Go used by the most recent App Engine SDKs, as [is being discussed](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-appengine-go/4AKjwr5d5a8) in the google-appengine-go Google Group.

A suggested workaround is to use a docker container to run the App Engine SDKs in the meantime. This repository is intended to serve that purpose.

Influenced by https://github.com/RobLoach/docker-google-appengine although this is a bit simpler with more up to date dependencies.
